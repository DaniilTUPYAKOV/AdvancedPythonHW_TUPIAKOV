     1  [Verse 1]
     2  Have you got colour in your cheeks?
     3  Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
     4  That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
     5  Are there some aces up your sleeve?
     6  Have you no idea that you're in deep?
     7  I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
     8  How many secrets can you keep?
     9  'Cause there's this tune I found
    10  That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
    11  Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee
    12
    13  [Pre-Chorus]
    14  (Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
    15  (Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
    16  (Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
    17  For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
    18
    19  [Chorus]
    20  Crawlin' back to you
    21  Ever thought of callin' when
    22  You've had a few?
    23  'Cause I always do
    24  Maybe I'm too
    25  Busy bein' yours
    26  To fall for somebody new
    27  Now, I've thought it through
    28  Crawlin' back to you
    29
    30  [Verse 2]
    31  So have you got the guts?
    32  Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
    33  And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
    34  Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
    35  It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
    36  But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
    37  But we could be together if you wanted to
    38
    39  [Pre-Chorus]
    40  (Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
    41  (Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
    42  (Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
    43  For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
    44
    45  [Chorus]
    46  Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
    47  Ever thought of callin' when
    48  You've had a few? (Had a few)
    49  'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
    50  Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)
    51  Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)
    52  To fall for somebody new
    53  Now, I've thought it through
    54  Crawlin' back to you
    55
    56  [Outro]
    57  (Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
    58  (Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
    59  (Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
    60  For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
    61  (Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall
    62  (Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'?
    63  (Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you?
