     1  [Verse 1]
     2  Have you got colour in your cheeks?
     3  Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
     4  That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
     5  Are there some aces up your sleeve?
     6  Have you no idea that you're in deep?
     7  I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
     8  How many secrets can you keep?
     9  'Cause there's this tune I found
    10  That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
    11  Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee
    12
    13  [Pre-Chorus]
    14  (Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?

    18
    19  [Chorus]
    20  Crawlin' back to you
    21  Ever thought of callin' when
    22  You've had a few?
    23  'Cause I always do
    24  Maybe I'm too
    25  Busy bein' yours
    26  To fall for somebody new
    27  Now, I've thought it through
    28  Crawlin' back to you
